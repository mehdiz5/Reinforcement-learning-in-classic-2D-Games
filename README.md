# Reinforcement-learning-in-classic-2D-Games
This is a small project I decided to make after seening the videos of [code bullet](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet) on youtube, for the sake of learning and hopefully making a small free course out of it.

## 1. **AtariGames: Almost Done**
Atari is a brand that was popular for producing video games and game consoles in the late 1970s and early 1980s. One of the most popular Atari games was simply called "Pong," which was released in 1972 and was one of the first video games ever created.

In "Pong," two players would use paddles to hit a ball back and forth across a screen. The game was simple but addictive, and it spawned countless imitators and sequels.

Other popular Atari games included "Space Invaders," which was released in 1978 and was a shooting game in which players had to destroy an alien invasion force. "Asteroids" was another popular Atari game, released in 1979, which challenged players to pilot a spaceship and shoot down asteroids while avoiding collisions.

Atari games were known for their simple, addictive gameplay and colorful graphics, and they helped to establish the video game industry as a major form of entertainment.

For our work we will be using:
- [Gym for the envirment](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/atari/)
- Keras-rl2 and Tensorflow for the model

## 2. **Tetris: Next**
