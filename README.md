# Reinforcement-learning-in-classic-2D-Games
This is a small project I decided to make after seening the videos of [code bullet](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeBullet) on youtube, for the sake of learning and hopefully making a small free course out of it.

## 1. **Pong: Almost Done**
In "Pong," two players would use paddles to hit a ball back and forth across a screen. The game was simple but addictive, and it spawned countless imitators and sequels.

## 2. **Tetris: Next**
